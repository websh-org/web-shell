The current state of the WebShell Desktop can be previewed at the <a target="_blank" href="https://websh.org/sandbox">WebShell Sandbox</a>.

There is a selection of apps to try out. Just click on the WebShell menu button in the top left corner.

For now, files can be opened and saved from the local computer. In the future, users will be able to connect to their files on cloud services. This will allow them to use WebShell apps with their files without giving apps the permission to access their file storage.
